Typelevel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and programming background. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the community organizers.
