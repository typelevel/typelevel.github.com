The [Typelevel Steering Committee][committee] is opening a call for
new members as we continue to build a [more transparent and
sustainable community][governing documents].

In 2021, co-founders Lars Hupel and Miles Sabin stepped down from
leadership.  We are all grateful for what they created and their
several years of service.  What remains is a generation of leadership
that has not expanded in a few years.  Retirements and additions alike
are healthy, balancing institutional memory with fresh energy.  It is
again a time for renewal.

Historically, leadership has invited prominent techical contributors
to join them.  This results in homogenous talent, experience, and
identity.  Our hope is that this open call for leaders will be heard
by a more well-rounded and diverse set of candidates to realize
Typelevel's mission.

## Mission

Typelevel is an association of projects and individuals united to
foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional
programming in Scala.

## Responsibilities

* Together, we are coders, organizers, writers, educators, publicists,
  moderators, recruiters, academics, and strategists.  You aren't all
  of these, but you think you can add something that's scarce.

* Membership is not a heavy burden, but neither is it an honorific.
  You will participate in [governance discussions][governance
  discussions], and are excited to reimagine the way we run.

* The current charter defines no fixed term.  You'll try to leave it
  better than you found it and when you're ready, hand the baton to
  someone who will do the same.

## Applying

Send an e-mail to [volunteer@typelevel.org](mailto:volunteer@typelevel.org)
to put yourself forward for consideration, optionally with a brief
case why you wish to serve.  The e-mail is visible only to the
[committee membership][committee].  We will thoughtfully consider all
serious applications and be discreet in our deliberation.  Accepted
candidacies will be public, but we will not disclose the identity of
anyone else.  We hope to hear from some who surprise us, or even yet
had the pleasure of meeting.  We are not looking for third-party
nominations, but if there's someone you'd like to see, encourage them
to apply!

The charter does not prescribe a committee size, but we hope to
welcome two to six new members this cycle, and consider more as
ambitions and capacity warrant.
