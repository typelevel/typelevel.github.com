As a result of
[LambdaConf's decision](http://degoes.net/articles/lambdaconf-inclusion)
to invite Curtis Yarvin as a speaker, the organizers of the Typelevel
Summit Boulder have decided that affiliation with LambdaConf is no
longer compatible with Typelevel's goals, and we are cancelling the
event, which was scheduled to happen on the Wednesday before the
conference.

Yarvin is an unapologetic proponent of bigotry. As a result of his
modest celebrity in this regard, it is not possible for his views to
be "left at the door." By extending a speaking invitation, LambdaConf
places him in a position of prestige and tacit endorsement that
Typelevel cannot accept.

We recognize LambdaConf's goal of "harmony in diversity" and applaud
them for sharing their deliberations, but respectfully disagree with
the outcome.
