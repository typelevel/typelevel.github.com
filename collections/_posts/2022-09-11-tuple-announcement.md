We are pleased to announce that we have set up a Typelevel team for [Tuple][tuple], a remote pair-programming application.
Tuple provides screen-sharing, audio and video calls (video is optional), as well as a very helpful screen drawing feature for whiteboarding.
Tuple clients are available for MacOS and Linux (beta).

We hope that Tuple will help the community by enabling maintainers to collaborate together more easily, and as a new way to onboard and share knowledge with new contributors.

There are [instructions in the Governance repo][tuple-docs] that cover how maintainers can join the Tuple team, and how others can get started.
Happy pairing!
