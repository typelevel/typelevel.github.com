Treelog
=======

[Treelog](https://github.com/lancewalton/treelog) is the result of a real problem that arose in a trading system that we were working on: 
> how can we audit absolutely everything that happens to a trade as it travels through our system?

The first (and tedious) answer is copius logging by writing to some kind of audit data type or logger.

There are a number of problems with this approach:

- writing logging in and around computations often complicates the code. Values must be extracted, recorded and then applied
- the decoupled nature of logging from the computation can lead to inaccurate logs
- linear logs are very difficult to follow
- its not easy to control how much of a linear log to show a user if you do not know what is detail and what isn't

Treelog is an experiment to resolve these issues by applying a couple of ideas from the Typeclassopedia: the Writer Monad and a cunning Monoid.

Note that I will refer you to the excellent Scalaz tutorial at [http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/]() to study the details of Scalaz where appropriate.

But first…

Using Treelog
-------------
Here is an example which illustrates how Treelog is used ([more examples](https://github.com/lancewalton/treelog#treelog-examples)):

```scala
val result: DescribedComputation[Int] = 
 "a description " ~< { 
  for {
   foo <- x ~> ("foo's value is " + _)
   bar <- y ~> ("bar's value is " + _)
   foobar <- (foo + bar) ~> ("foo + bar = " + _)
  } yield foobar 
 }
```

`DescribedComputation[Value]` is just a type alias for `EitherT[LogTreeWriter, String, Value]` and so the log and value can be retrieved with `result.run.written` and `result.run.value`. The tree will have a root node with `"a description"` and children describing the values of foo and bar and the sum.

The EitherT, a [Monad Transformer](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Monad+transformers.html) enables us to represent success and failure of the computation whilst carrying the log.

In Treelog we distinguish between tree nodes that describe a computation as children, a so-called `DescribedComputation`, as in the example above, and an `UndescribedComputation` which is a Tree with no description in the root.

This is an important distinction that informs the way trees must be combined by our Treelog Monoid, which the Writer needs.

What is a Writer?
----------------

> Writer allows us to do computations while making sure that all the log values are combined into one log value that then gets attached to the result. [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more)

So Writers allow us to write a log embedded within a computation.

Here is a simple example using Scalaz, see the references for more detailed examples.

```scala
val r: Writer[String, Int] = 
  for {
    a ← 3.set("Got a 3.")
    b ← 5.set("Got a 5.")
  } yield a * b

println(r.written) // Got a 3.Got a 5.
println(r.value) // 15
```
The Writer uses a monoid for the written value (a String in this case) to combine the logs (concatenate for String).

What is a Monoid?
----------------

> A Monoid is a type with an associative binary operation (append) and an identity value. 

For String, append is concatenation and identity is the empty String, for Lists its append and Nil, etc.

Back to Treelog?
---------------

Treelog uses a Scalaz [Writer](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Writer.html), [Tree](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Tree.html) and a custom [Monoid](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Monoid.html) implementation to record logs. Treelog also adds some extra syntax which I'll cover below, but the main ingredient is the Monoid implementation.

The Treelog monoid has to do two things, provide a `zero` value and a binary operation that combines two trees. The zero value for Treelog is just a constant used internally to the Monoid implementation and never leaks out since there is always at least one value being logged.

Combining trees is done as follows:

- A zero Tree with a tree is just the tree
- Two Undescribed Trees become a new Undescribed Tree with the children of the right Tree *appended* to the children of the left Tree
- An Undescribed Tree T1, and a Described Tree, T2, becomes an Undescribed Tree with T2 *appended* to the children of T1
- A Described Tree, T1, and an Undescribed Tree, T2, is an Undescribed Tree with T1 *prepended* to the children of T2
- Two Described Trees are combined by creating an Undescribed Tree with the two trees as children

Success and Failure
---------

Actually, what I've described above is the basic idea. But logging is more complex than that, we want to indicate whether something has been successful or not. This is traditionally done with an Either type, with Left indicating failure and Right indicating success.

To combine the Writer behaviour with Either, we need to use a Monad Transformer. Fortunately, Scalaz provides us with the transformer in EitherT.
