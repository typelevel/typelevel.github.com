Treelog
=======

[Treelog](https://github.com/lancewalton/treelog) is the result of a real problem that arose in a trading system that we were working on: 
> how can we audit absolutely everything that happens to a trade as it travels through our system?

The first (and tedious) answer is copius logging of the form: `log.info("The trade was accepted.")`

There are a number of problems with this approach:

- writing logging in and around computations often complicates the code. Values must be extracted, recorded and then applied
- the decoupled nature of logging from the computation can lead to inaccurate logs
- linear logs are very difficult to follow
- its not easy to control how much of log to show a user if you do not know what is detail and what isn't

Treelog is an experiment to resolve these issues by applying a couple of ideas from the Typeclassopedia: the Writer Monad and a cunning Monoid.

Whats are Writers and Monoids
-----------------

There are a number of examples and explanations of the Writer (see the references below). But put simply, Learn You a Haskell states: 
> Writer allows us to do computations while making sure that all the log values are combined into one log value that then gets attached to the result.

Here is a simple example, see the references for more detailed examples.

```scala
val r: Writer[String, Int] = 
  for {
    a ← 3.set("Got a 3.")
    b ← 5.set("Got a 5.")
  } yield a * b

println(r.written) // Got a 3.Got a 5.
println(r.value) // 15
```
The Writer uses a monoid for the written value (a String in this case) to combine the logs (concatenate for String).

So whats a Monoid? 
> A Monoid is a type with an associative binary operation (append) and an identity value. 

For Strings that is concatenation and the empty String, for Lists its append and Nil, etc.

Back to Treelog
---------------

Treelog uses a [scalaz](http://typelevel.org/) Writer, [Tree](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Tree.scala) and a custom [Monoid](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Monoid.scala) implementation to record logs. Treelog also adds some extra syntax which I'll cover below, but the main ingredient is the Monoid implementation.

The Treelog monoid has to do two things, provide a `zero` value and a binary operation that combines two trees. 

The zero value for Treelog is just a constant used internally to the Monoid implementation and never leaks out since there is always at least one value being logged.

The append operation is more interesting since it needs to combine two Trees. There are two different kinds of trees: *Described* and *Undescribed*. A Described Tree is formed like this:
```scala
"a description" ~< {
  for {
    …
   } yield …
 }
```
Here, the Tree will consist of a root containing `a description` whose children are the logs in the for comprehension.

An Undescribed Tree has no log.

Combining these trees is done as follows:

- A zero Tree with Tree, T, is T
- Two Undescribed Trees become a new Undescribed Tree with the children of the right Tree appended to the children of the left Tree
- An Undescribed Tree, T1, and a Described Tree, T2, is an Undescribed Tree with the children of T2 *appended* to the children of T1
- A Described Tree, T1, and an Undescribed Tree, T2, is an Undescribed Tree with T1 *prepended* to the children of T2
- Two Described Trees are combined by creating an Undescribed Tree with the two Described Trees as children

I Lied
------

Actually, what I've described above is the basic idea. But logging is more complex than that, we want to indicate whether something has been successful or not. This is traditionally done with an Either type, with Left indicating failure and Right indicating success.

To combine the Writer behaviour with Either, we need to use a Monad Transformer. Fortunately, Scalaz provides us with the transformer in EitherT.
