Treelog
=======

[Treelog](https://github.com/lancewalton/treelog) is the result of a real problem that arose in a trading system that
we were working on: how can we audit absolutely everything that happens to a trade as it travels through our system?

The first (and tedious) answer is copius logging of the form: `log.info("The trade was accepted.")`

There are a number of problems with this approach:
- writing logging in and around computation often complicates the code. Values must be extracted, recorded and then applied
- the decoupled nature of the logging from the computation itself can lead to mismatches in what is happening and what is being reported
- linear logs are very difficult to follow in log files
- its not easy to control how much of log to show a user if you do not know what is detail and what isn't

Treelog is an experiment to resolve these issues by applying a couple of ideas from the Typeclassopedia: the Writer Monad and a cunning Monoid.

Writer and Monoid
-----------------

There are a number of examples and explanations of the Writer (see the references below). But put simply, Learn You a Haskell states: 
> Writer allows us to do computations while making sure that all the log values are combined into one log value that then gets attached to the result.

Here is a simple example, see the references for more detailed examples.

```scala
val r: Writer[String, Int] = 
  for {
    a ← 3.set("Got a 3.")
    b ← 5.set("Got a 5.")
  } yield a * b

println(r.written) // Got a 3.Got a 5.
println(r.value) // 15
```
The Writer uses a monoid for the written value (a String in this case) to combine the logs (concatenate for String).

A Monoid is a type with an associative binary operation and an identity value. For Strings that is concatenation and the empty String, for Lists its append and Nil, etc.

---------------

Treelog uses a scalaz Writer with scalaz's Tree and a custom Monoid to record logs. The Monoid for the Tree combines the
