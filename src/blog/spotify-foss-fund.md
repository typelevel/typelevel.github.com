# Spotify FOSS Fund 2024

We're excited to announce that Typelevel has been chosen as a recipient of the 2024 Spotify FOSS Fund!
As a result, Spotify has donated €20,000 to [Typelevel's OpenCollective.][opencollective]

Our current funding goes towards recurring infrastructure expenses, and sending members of our code of conduct committee for training to better support our community.
With these extra funds we’d like to expand our initiatives to encourage and support new contributors and users!
We’ve specifically discussed funding student or first time contributors through an initiative like Outreachy and engaging a technical writer to help improve documentation.

You can read more about the 2024 Spotify FOSS Fund and the other recipients over at [Spotify's engineering blog.][spotify-blog]
