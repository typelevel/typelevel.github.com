# Welcoming New Steering Committee Members

Since our [last post][last-post], the [Typelevel Steering Committee][committee] has happily welcomed six new members to our group: Zach McCoy, Sam Pillsworth, Jasna Rodulfa-Blemberg, Andrew Valencik, Vasil Vasilev, and Mark Waks (aka Justin du Coeur). In their own words:

[Zach McCoy][zach] (he/him)

I've been programming in Scala professionally for 10 years. I currently work at [Jack Henry][jack-henry] where I get to work in Scala and deal with observability in systems.  I'm based in Iowa where I work remotely.  I can usually be found reading or playing Magic: The Gathering.  

[Sam Pillsworth][sam] (she/her)

I’ve been writing code in industry for about 7 years, and the programming before that doesn’t count because it was in Fortran. Currently I'm a senior data developer writing Scala to power search in the [Shopify][shopify] [Help Center][shopify-helpcenter]. I’m based out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In my free time I read a lot of books, play with my dog Janeway, and futz with my emacs config.

[Jasna Rodulfa-Blemberg][jasna] (she/they)

I've been programming in Scala for the past 5 years, and more broadly in the JVM for most of my 9-year career. I currently work for [Etsy][etsy], where I help scale and maintain their search platform using Scala. I work remotely from the Washington, DC, USA area with my partner and the wild rabbits in my yard. 

I love cooking, gaming, reading, writing, and staying fit. More recently, I've begun reviving my Japanese language skills from college.

[Andrew Valencik][andrew] (he/him)

I've been writing Scala for 6ish years, on and off. Currently I manage a data science team and a developer team at [Shopify][shopify] working on search systems in the support area. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

I like cooking when I have all day to do it, being outside, and rotating through hobbies.

[Vasil Vasilev][vasil] (he/him)

I've been doing Scala for about 5 years now and for about 3 years in the open-source community. I'm a software developer at [JetBrains][jetbrains], working on the Scala Plugin team out of Munich, Germany.

I like to split my free time between cycling, gaming and reading, as well as Scala open-source contributions, especially Cats Effect.

[Mark Waks, aka Justin du Coeur][justin] (he/him)

I've been programming for about 40 years in a wide variety of languages, the past 10 full-time in Scala. My current dayjob is at [Troops][troops] (now part of Slack/Salesforce), working remotely from Somerville, MA; in my spare time, I run [Querki][querki], a sort of wiki/database hybrid written entirely in Scala.

I'm a pretty generalized geek, active in SCA, LARP, SF/F fandom, board games, comics, etc. I'm in charge of the Boston Scala Meetup, and on the board of the NE Scala conference (both currently dormant due to covid).

--------

These new members are excited to continue Typelevel's efforts to foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional programming in Scala. You can find the members throughout the [Typelevel GitHub space][github] and on our [Discord server][discord] with the `@steering` role.
