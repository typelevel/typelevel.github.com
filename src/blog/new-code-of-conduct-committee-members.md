# Code of Conduct Committee

A few months back the Typelevel Steering Committee put out [a call for new members](call-for-code-of-conduct-committee-members.md) to join the Typelevel Code of Conduct Committee. Thank you very much to all who applied, it's lovely to see folks interested in keeping our community safe.

Since that time, the Typelevel Steering Committee voted in three new members to the Code of Conduct Committee! The committee now has five members total.

Here are some brief introductions to our current committee members.

#### Lucas Satabin (he/him)

> I've been using Scala since 2009 both professionally and personally, and the Typelevel ecosystem since the scalac fork. Since then I have been trying to contribute libraries in the ecosystem on a regular basis. I currently work at [commercetools](https://commercetools.com/).
>
> I am based in the Paris area in France, and in my free time I like to play board games, TTRPGs, CRPGs, and I read a lot of comic books (mostly European and American). Baking bread, making mustard, and brewing slow coffees are my favorite kitchen based activities. I also tend to talk too much about trains.

#### Kateu Herbert (he/him)

> I’ve been programming with Scala for about 5 years now. I am a statistician by profession, currently working as a data analyst for [Enveritas](https://www.enveritas.org/) based in Kampala, Uganda. I use Scala for all my personal projects and in my free time, I share my knowledge through [blog posts](https://hkateu.github.io/kateuherbert.github.io/). Other hobbies include playing around with Linux distros, training my dog, and watching and reading about tech related content.

#### Arman Bilge (he/him)

> I'm Arman, based in Seattle, and I have been involved with Typelevel for almost four years now. I was first drawn to contribute by the welcoming and friendly people in our Discord! This community is near and dear to me and I am committed to fostering a safe and inclusive environment where we can work, learn and play together :)

#### Sam Pillsworth (she/her)

> Hi, I'm Sam! I'm part of the Typelevel Steering Committee and now also the code of conduct committee! I care deeply about the Typelevel community and creating a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. I live in Canada, and when I'm not doing computer related activities I like to read books and play with my dog.

#### Andrew Valencik (he/him)

> Hi, I'm Andrew, I live in Ottawa, Canada. I hang out around Typelevel because the people are kind and welcoming. I want to help keep our community a safe and fun space. I think the libraries are pretty cool too and enjoy contributing to open source when I can. When I'm not thinking about computers I'm probably thinking about food or my two cats.

#### What does this mean for our community?

Code of Conduct members will work in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/typelevel/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [Enforcement Policy](https://github.com/typelevel/governance/blob/main/ENFORCEMENT-POLICY.md). 
The team is expected to evaluate reported incidents about Code of Conduct violations and propose behavior adjustments or consequences for the reported behavior which will be done with the help of community moderators. 
This ensures Code of Conduct violations are dealt with promptly and all community members feel welcome and safe as part of the Typelevel community.
