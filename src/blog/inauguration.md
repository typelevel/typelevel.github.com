So, here it is, the typelevel.scala blog!

What is it about?
-----------------

As you might already know, typelevel.scala is a collection of libraries which provide a great amount of abstraction.
Here, we would like to show how to use them in your code, provide examples, collect learning resources, and explore implementation details.

Who writes here?
----------------

Everyone who would like to! Contributions are welcome.
If you want to share something about Scalaz, Shapeless, Spire, or Scala topics in general (e.g. type classes), case studies, examples, or other related content, please do not hesitate to contact us.
This blog (and in fact, the whole web site) is built using Jekyll on GitHub pages, so you can just fork the [repository](https://github.com/typelevel/typelevel.github.com), add a post, and create a pull request.

Stay tuned!
-----------

We hope that this blog will be filled with content soon.
To make sure that you don't miss anything, follow [@typelevel](https://twitter.com/typelevel) on Twitter or subscribe to the [RSS feed](/blog/feed.rss).
