## About the Meetup

Join the Typelevel community at an [in-person meetup][luma] on EPFL campus in Lausanne, organized by [Arman Bilge] and [Antonio Jimenez]. This meetup is open to (aspiring) Typelevel users and contributors and anyone curious to learn more about functional programming in Scala, no matter their prior experience.

During this meetup you can expect:

* chat/q&a about functional programming and Typelevel libraries
* a small tutorial on [Cats Effect], [FS2], and [Calico]
* a group activity building widgets with Calico
* lunch

More details and registration are available on the [event page][luma]. All participants and organizers must abide by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct].
