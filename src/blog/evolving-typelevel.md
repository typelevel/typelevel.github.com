# Evolving Typelevel

In recent years, Typelevel has existed in a somewhat grey area legally. We have long managed a good deal of intellectual
property (the Organization Libraries) and raised funds. In 2022, [we adopted a Charter](/blog/2022/01/19/governing-documents.html) establishing our governance.
However, we have not had a well-defined legal status.

We have decided it is time to become a legally-recognized organization. To that end, we have formed the Typelevel
Foundation, a nonprofit organization incorporated in the United States, in the state of California. Additionally, we are applying for
501(c)(3) tax-exempt status from the IRS (the US tax agency), but this process will take several months.

The initial Board of Directors for the Foundation will be:

* Arman Bilge
* Daniel Spiewak
* Andrew Valencik
* Mark Waks (known in the community as Justin du Coeur)

Arman will also be acting as our interim, part-time Executive Director. In the coming months, we will refine the
mission of the Foundation and define the roles that will carry out its work.

The Foundation Board will assume the responsibilities of governance, particularly legal and financial matters.
Meanwhile, the Steering Committee will become the Technical Steering Committee and focus on the technical work of
overseeing the Typelevel ecosystem. (The Code of Conduct Committee and Security Team will also continue their essential
work.) Our intent is that, by separating the governance and technical responsibilities, everyone can better focus on
what they enjoy and are good at.

### Updates to the Technical Steering Committee

Besides the new name and refined scope of the Technical Steering Committee, we are also announcing changes to its
membership. Zach McCoy and Jasna Rodulfa-Blemberg have completed their terms on the Committee; we thank them for their
service!

### Next steps

Our core mission remains the same: we will continue to steward the code and culture that are at the heart of Typelevel.
This transition supports our ongoing effort to build a more transparent and sustainable organization that serves our
growing community. Please stay tuned for upcoming announcements of new initiatives, a roadmap for the Foundation, and
opportunities to become involved.
