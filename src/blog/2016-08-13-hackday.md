# Hack the Tower – Typelevel & Scala hack day

![Hack the Tower – Typelevel & Scala hack day](/img/media/hackday.jpg)

## About the Hackday

This is the fourth Typelevel hack day in conjunction with the [London Scala User Group](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/) and [Hack The Tower](http://hackthetower.co.uk/).

Join users of and contributors to [Typelevel projects](/projects/README.md) and [Typelevel Scala](https://github.com/typelevel/scala) and learn how to put them to good use in your own projects and how to make them better for the whole Scala community!

At the [July Typelevel hack day](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/232075459/) we had people working on the Scala compiler, a Monocle workshop, people working on Ensime and people working through introductory Scala problems and exercises ... something for everyone whatever their level of expertise.

Please come and join us, and if there's anything you'd like to chat about beforehand head over to the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/hack-the-tower).
