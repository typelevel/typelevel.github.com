# Typelevel Summit Boston

![Typelevel Summit Boston](/img/media/cambridge.jpg)

## About the Summit

The fifth Typelevel Summit will once again be co-located with the [Northeast Scala Symposium](http://www.nescala.org/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with one day of recorded talks and one day of (shared) unconference.
The unconference will happen on March 18, NE Scala on March 19, and finally, the Summit on March 20.
For tickets and other information about attending, please visit the website of the [Northeast Scala Symposium](http://www.nescala.org/).

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

This is a community conference and we strive to make it an inclusive and fulfilling event for all participants. All attendees, speakers, and organizers must abide by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](/conduct.html).
