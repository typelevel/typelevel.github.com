## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct & reporting of incidents are handled together with the team of the Northeast Scala Symposium.
You can find details on <a href="https://nescala.io/#code">their website</a>.
In short: there is a Slack team where you can report incidents to the organizers, to which every ticket holder should have received an invitation.
It is possible to file anonymous reports.
