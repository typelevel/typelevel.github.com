# GitHub Seats

As we continue to grow our community on GitHub, we've encountered a challenge with our seat limit for maintainers.
It's important to note that each maintainer seat incurs a fee.
By managing our maintainers more efficiently, we can allocate resources effectively and sustain the growth of our community.

In order to be able to add new members, we've recently conducted a review and removed 25 accounts that have not been active on the organization since January 1st, 2023.

We understand that circumstances may vary, and if you believe your account was removed in error, we want to hear from you!
Please don't hesitate to reach out to us, and we'll happily re-add you as a maintainer.
