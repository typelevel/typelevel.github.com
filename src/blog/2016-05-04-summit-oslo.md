# Typelevel Summit Oslo

![Typelevel Summit Oslo](/img/media/oslo.jpg)

## About the Summit

The second Typelevel Summit was co-located with <a href="http://2016.flatmap.no/">flatMap(Oslo)</a>.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!
