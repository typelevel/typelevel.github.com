The schedule for this year is as follows:

## Important Update

Due to the current situation regarding COVID-19, we are changing the Typelevel Summit and NE Scala to be online-only. Many attendees have been asked by their employers not to travel or attend conferences. We apologize to anyone who's inconvenienced by this, but we hope you'll still attend remotely.
For more information please visit the [NE Scala website](https://nescala.io/).
