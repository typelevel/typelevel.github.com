# Virtual Meetups

Every month, we host a friendly virtual meetup for the Typelevel Community! Each meetup begins with an icebreaker activity to get to know each other, followed by a presentation on a technical topic.

Our meetups are open to everyone! All participants must follow the [Typelevel Code of Conduct].
