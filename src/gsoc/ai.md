# Typelevel GSoC AI Policy

Our AI policy is based on the following ideas.

* **Respect maintainer time.** Our maintainers and GSoC mentors are volunteers who invest many hours reviewing open source contributions to ensure that Typelevel projects have high-quality, maintainable codebases. Please respect their time by submitting your best work.

* **GSoC is about learning first, delivering second.** We prefer that you take your time and ask for help when contributing to our projects, rather than using AI to quickly write code that may work, but you do not understand. Our midterm and final evaluations of your work will consider how you grew as an open source contributor, in addition to what you created.

* **AI has become a part of the contemporary developer's toolkit.** We do not want to blanket ban the use of AI. We recognize its value when used thoughtfully and want to support you in learning when and how to use AI effectively.

With these principles in mind, to contribute to Typelevel as part of GSoC we ask you to follow these rules.

1. **Demonstrate ownership of your code**, no matter how you wrote it. This means understanding how it works and being capable of explaining that and also creating and performing tests to confirm that it works correctly, both for yourself and for your collaborators. It is okay to ask for help!

2. ***Never* use AI to generate descriptions for PRs or issues.** Similarly, please do not use AI to write your GSoC proposal or other communications such as email and Discord messages. The purpose of writing in these contexts is to organize your thoughts and directly communicate your ideas, not to craft a "polished" document. However, you may use AI to translate between English and another (natural) language.

3. **Always communicate when you have used AI** to write code, typically in your PR description. It is also helpful to explain where and how you used it, such as by including any prompts.
