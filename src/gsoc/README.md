# Welcome!

Typelevel is an ecosystem of projects and a community of people united to foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional programming in Scala.
We work together to develop projects that apply functional programming to challenging problems relevant in industry.
Our community culture embraces curiosity and mentoring and we don’t shy away from experimenting with new and exciting ideas.
Most of all, we love to make programming joyful and social.

We are excited to be a Mentoring Organization in [Google Summer of Code 2026][GSoC]! If you are interested to join Typelevel as a GSoC Contributor, here are some ways to get started:
