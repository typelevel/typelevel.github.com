# Colophon

We build this website with our own Scala-based tooling! It is statically generated with [Laika], a Typelevel project for transforming Markdown into HTML sites and e-books. The search bar is powered by [Protosearch], an in-memory search library with advanced querying features. Both projects use [Cats] and other Typelevel libraries.

UI components are provided by the [Bulma] CSS framework and icons by [Font Awesome]. Mathematical expressions are rendered during the build with [KaTeX] running on [GraalJS].

We deploy to [GitHub Pages].

If you encounter a problem with our website or have feedback, please open an issue on the [repository]. We also welcome contributions!
