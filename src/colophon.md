# Colophon

We build this website with our own tooling! It is statically generated with [Laika], a Typelevel project for transforming Markdown into HTML sites and e-books. The search bar is powered by [Protosearch], an in-memory search library with advanced querying features. Both projects use [Cats] and other Typelevel libraries. Finally, UI components are provided by the [Bulma] CSS framework and we deploy to [GitHub Pages].

If you encounter a problem with our website or have feedback, please open an issue on the [repository]. We also welcome contributions!
