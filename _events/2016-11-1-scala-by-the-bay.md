## About the Conference

Scala By the Bay is the yearly conference of SF Scala, the largest Scala meetup and community in the world, with the highest concentration of Scala developers and companies running Scala as a foundation of their global operations. The conference is held continuously since 2013, with all the videos published on [functional.tv](http://functional.tv/). In 2015, expanded with Twitter OSS conference, [FinagleCon](http://finagle.github.io/finaglecon/), and bringing in a wealth of Twitter Stack, powering the global conversation, and Big Data Scala By the Bay -- the synthesis of data engineering and data science with Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and emerging streaming

Scala By the Bay is not just another tech conference. It is a learning institution, upholding thoughtful software engineering practices, enabling companies to build Twitter-scale reactive data pipelines, and sharing best practices for full-stack construction, from immutable containerized devops to backend, to front-end, with test-driven development, monitoring, continuous deployment, Machine Learning enabling user engagement, and more.
