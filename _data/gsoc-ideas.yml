- title: Native I/O backend for FS2 JVM
  description:
    FS2 on the JVM currently implements its networking API using JDK NIO. Unfortunately this indirection incurs a non-trivial performance penalty. We want to replace the use of JDK NIO with direct calls to system I/O APIs such as `epoll` and `kqueue`.
  prereqs: Scala, ability to read C
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: FS2 Connection API
  description:
    TCP-based protocols are common (e.g. HTTP, Postgres, Redis) and are implemented by clients to interface with these services (e.g. Ember, Skunk, Rediculous). The goal of this project is to create a "connection" API that supports pooling, error conditions, and metrics and can be shared by all of our client libraries.
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some knowledge of networking
  difficulty: Hard.

- title: Web Components for Calico
  description:
    Calico is a reactive UI library built with Cats Effect and FS2. Web Components are a standard for creating framework-agnostic, reusable UI elements. The goal of this project is to enable Calico users to access the vast array of web components available by improving its DSL and code-generation.
  prereqs: Scala, ideally experience with Web APIs
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Upgrade sbt-typelevel to sbt 2
  description:
    sbt-typelevel is a plugin for sbt, the Scala build tool, used by hundreds of open source and enterprise projects. sbt 2 is in the final stages of development. We want to upgrade sbt-typelevel to sbt 2 and adopt its new features, such as "project matrix" for cross-building.
  prereqs: Scala
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Refresh Davenverse projects
  description:
    The Davenverse is a collection of several popular Typelevel libraries, including Mules and cats-scalacheck. Unfortunately, we have fallen behind on their maintenance. We want to move these libraries under the Typelevel org, refresh their build tooling, and bring them up-to-date to ensure their longevity.
  prereqs: Scala
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Cats Effect & FS2 on Wasm/WASI
  description:
    Web Assembly and its System Interface are emerging technologies for deploying secure, modular applications. The goal of this project is to prototype porting the Cats Effect runtime and FS2 streaming I/O to the Wasm/WASI platform, also possibly generating feedback for the Scala WASM and WASI teams.
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with Wasm/WASI
  difficulty: Hard. Wasm/WASI support in Scala is experimental.

- title: A faster immutable list datatype
  description:
    Immutable linked lists are a core datatype in functional programming languages. The goal of this project is to explore implementing a list-like datatype with enhanced performance. Along the way, you will learn about immutable datatypes, Cats typeclasses, and mechanical sympathy.
  prereqs: Interest in functional programming
  difficulty: Medium. This is a good project for beginners!
