- title: Machine learning inference in Cats Effect
  description:
    We want to make it possible to deploy machine learning inference as part of a larger web service without compromising the latency of other on-going requests. The goal of this project is to create a compiler to transform a pre-trained ML model into a sequence of Cats Effect `IO` steps that perform inference on some input.
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with ML
  difficulty: Hard but doable. Will draw on knowledge of ML and compilers.

- title: "Streaming msgpack implementation"
  description: "The [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/) data format allows for efficient binary serialization of data. It would be great to have the ability to parse, transform, and emit data in a streaming fashion using FS2 in the [fs2-data](https://fs2-data.gnieh.org) library."
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with FS2 and parsing
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Scaladoc Search in Protosearch
  description:
    Protosearch offers an in-browser search experience for documentation. This project aims to add support for Scaladoc, the documentation system for Scala code. As a result of this work, searching for `flatMap` on the cats-effect documentation, for example, would return hits from the tutorial and the relevant method in the Scaladoc.
  prereqs: Scala
  difficulty: Medium.
  length: long
  mentors: [valencik]
  categories: [data, web]

- title: Fluent library for files and processes
  description:
    FS2 has powerful APIs for streaming I/O but using it in small scripts can involve boilerplate. This project aims to create a fluent library for working with files and processes in Scala. A particular focus will be easy integration with the [Typelevel Toolkit](https://typelevel.org/toolkit).
  prereqs: Scala, interest in Functional Programming
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Serverless integrations for Feral
  description:
    Feral is a Typelevel library for building serverless functions that currently supports AWS Lambda. We want to support other cloud providers, such as Google, Cloudflare, and Vercel.
  prereqs: Scala, interest in Functional Programming, ideally experience with serverless
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Native I/O backend for FS2 JVM
  description:
    FS2 on the JVM currently implements its networking API using JDK NIO. Unfortunately this indirection incurs a non-trivial performance penalty. We want to replace the use of JDK NIO with direct calls to system I/O APIs such as `epoll` and `kqueue`.
  prereqs: Scala, ability to read C
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Production-ready io_uring interop layer
  description: A GSoC 2023 project prototyped a new networking I/O layer for FS2 based on the Linux io_uring syscall interface that improved the performance of HTTP servers by more than 3x. Now we need help to make this production-ready by writing code to interoperate with io_uring from the JVM.
  prereqs: Java or Scala, ideally some experience with C and JNI
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: "Streaming implementation of an XQuery subset"
  description: "XQuery allows for transforming XML data in a declarative way. Based on the generic streaming query engine added into the [fs2-data](https://fs2-data.gnieh.org) library, write a frontend to implement a streamable subset of XQuery."
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with XQuery
  difficulty: Hard.

- title: "Enhancements for the cross-platform otel4s tracing module"
  description: "A GSoC 2023 project prototyped a cross-platform implementation of the Open Telemetry tracing specification. We are exploring options to further enhance and address missing features in this implementation."
  prereqs: Scala, interest in Functional Programming
  difficulty: Medium.
